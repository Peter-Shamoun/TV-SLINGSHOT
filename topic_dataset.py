4. Create the 5 datasets for each individual topic, not correlated to slingshot making

5. Dataset Properties and Isolation Strategy

    Key Properties for Topic Isolation:
    - Each dataset must avoid slingshot terminology entirely
    - Questions should span multiple application domains per topic
    - Focus on the fundamental engineering principles, not specific applications
    - Answers should demonstrate the core concept without cross-contamination
    - Use varied technical vocabulary to prevent overfitting to specific domains

    Quality Control Measures:
    - Verify no questions accidentally combine multiple topics
    - Ensure domain diversity within each topic (minimum 3 different fields per dataset)
    - Test that answers focus on the isolated concept without bleeding into others
    - Validate that the 5 topics remain orthogonal when tested separately
