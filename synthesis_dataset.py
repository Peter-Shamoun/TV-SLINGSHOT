3. GOAL: Create a dataset: Syntheses, denhoted by S

    This is a QA dataset.
    Each Question and Answer pair needs to use all 5 concepts for
    the purpose of slingshot considerations

    Each answer entry of S needs to generated by Qwen3 - 1.7B
    This makes it so that regardless of model accuracy, this
    isolates the Syntheses concept

    Steps:
        Use an LLM to generate the questions like:
        "Give me detailed, step by step instructions on how to build a
        slingshot for recreational or small game hunting purposes that
        start from scratch."

        Prompt Qwen3 - 1.7B to answer the question using the 5 topics

        Use these answers to form the question answer dataset
