As an abstraction, we can say that to build a slingshot for 
recreational or small game hunting purposes, these are the core
steps required:


1. Material Selection:
    - Choice of wood/plastic for frame of the slingshot
    - Choice of rubber/string for the slingshot
    - Choice of glue/tape

2. Basic woodworking / fabrication
    - Cutting and sanding the frame of the slingshot
    - Drilling holes for the rubber of the slingshot
    - Shaping a frame into specific dimenstions

3. Mechanical design
    - frame geometry
    - attachment points
    - tension paths
    - balance and wobble mitigation

4. Fastening & assembly techniques
    - knots
    - loops
    - wrapping
    - gluing
    - taping
    - securing elastic elements

5. Release mechanism desig
    - simple pin/lever concepts
    - how to hold and release tensioned strings


These concepts are integral in the step by step process of creating the 
slingshot, but are aslo isolateable, and used in differenct concepts:


1. Material Selection

- Concept: pick materials by properties and trade-offs 
(strength, elasticity, weight, machinability).
- Subtopics: tensile strength, elasticity, timber types, polymers,
 grip materials.
- Domains: product design, civil/aerospace, medical devices, 
consumer goods.

2. Woodworking / Fabrication

- Concept: shape raw stock to final form; manage fits and finishes.
- Subtopics: measuring/layout, cutting, sanding, drilling, finishing.
- Domains: furniture, prototyping, construction, modelmaking.

3. Mechanical Design

- Concept: arrange geometry so loads flow predictably; control 
stiffness and stability.
- Subtopics: load paths, attachment placement, stiffness vs. compliance,
 damping.
- Domains: structural engineering, robotics, automotive, sports gear.

4. Fastening & Assembly

- Concept: join parts with methods chosen for load, reversibility, 
environment.
- Subtopics: mechanical fasteners, adhesives, wraps, knots, surface prep.
- Domains: manufacturing, marine rigging, textiles, field repairs.

5. Release Mechanisms

- Concept: retain stored energy; permit controlled, intentional 
release with fail-safes.
- Subtopics: latches vs. friction, trigger ergonomics, redundancy, wear.
- Domains: machinery, automotive closures, packaging, theatrical rigging.
