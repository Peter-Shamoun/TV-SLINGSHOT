1. Asked Qwen3 - 1.7B:
    Give me detailed, step by step instructions on how to build a 
    slingshot for recreational or small game hunting purposes that
    starts from scratch.

    It's response is in base_instructions.txt
    
    This resonse was analyzed and 5 topics were extracted

2. topics.txt includes these 5 topics, their scope in relation to
slingshot making, and how they can be isolated and used in other Domains

    These topics are:
        1. Material Selection:
        2. Basic woodworking / fabrication
        3. Mechanical design
        4. Fastening & assembly techniques
        5. Release mechanism design
            

3. Create a dataset: Syntheses, denhoted by S 

    This is a QA dataset. 
    Each Question and Answer pair needs to use all 5 concepts for
    the purpose of slingshot considerations

    Each answer entry of S needs to generated by Qwen3 - 1.7B
    This makes it so that regardless of model accuracy, this 
    isolates the Syntheses concept

    Steps: 
        Use an LLM to generate the questions like:
        "Give me detailed, step by step instructions on how to build a 
        slingshot for recreational or small game hunting purposes that
        start from scratch."

        Prompt Qwen3 - 1.7B to answer the question using the 5 topics

        Use these answers to form the question answer dataset

        Notes: Thinking revleas topic restriction. Finetuning will only occur on content tokens

4. Create the 5 datasets for each indivisual topic, not correlated to slingshot making

    dataset 1: Material Selection
        - This dataset will be about question answer pairs regarding
